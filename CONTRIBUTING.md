# Running apps locally

## Workspace Setup

This setup is recommended but not enforced. Please note that we expect clean well formated code and these tools make it easier for us to have a consistent code style throughout the codebase.

### Node.js

We recommended to use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to install Node v14

### Yarn

We use [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) as the package manager. Please do not use `npm` with this project to manage dependencies. It will result in clashing dependencies and may cause unintended errors.

To add new dependency use `yarn add`, so if you need to run `npm install <package>` run `yarn add <package>`.

### VSCode

The text editor of choice. You can choose any other as long as they support [prettier](https://prettier.io/).

#### Extension - [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)

We have a `.prettierrc.json` file, which would make prettier consisitent across all the developers of the project.
