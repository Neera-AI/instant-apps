## Anatomy of Snippet App

A snippet app is a Javascript object with following schema:

- `name`
- `description`
- `queryToData`: A function which takes a search query and converts into any data which could be displayed.
- `Component`: The React component of the app. The data from `queryToData` is passed as a prop.

Read more about the [architecture](https://github.com/felvin-search/docs/blob/master/rfcs/001_snippet_apps.md).
